#### 1. Chat Counts

* **Definition**: The total number of individual chat sessions started with your bot.
* **Why It Matters**:
  * Shows how many people are actively engaging with your chatbot.
  * Helps you compare activity trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
* **Tip**: If you notice a high number of chats but low conversions, refine your bot’s greeting message and fallback responses.

***

#### 2. Messages

* **Definition**: The total number of messages exchanged between users and your chatbot.
* **Why It Matters**:
  * More messages usually mean deeper engagement.
  * Sudden spikes may indicate customers are seeking more detailed support.
* **Plan Limits**: Each plan includes a set number of **monthly AI messages** (e.g., 50 in Free, 3,000 in Essential). Monitor this metric closely to avoid hitting limits.

***

#### 3. Storage Characters

* **Definition**: The number of characters (text data) stored in your chatbot’s knowledge base.
* **Why It Matters**:
  * Each plan comes with a maximum storage allocation (10M in Free, 40M in Business).
  * Storage is used for documents, pasted text, and URLs you train your bot with.
* **Tip**:
  * Keep your knowledge base clean — remove outdated or irrelevant content.
  * Use multiple bots if you have different departments or product lines (to spread out storage).

***

#### Example Use Case

* A company starts with **50 chats** and **200 messages** in the first week.
* The storage shows **2M characters used** out of 10M.
* Insight: The bot is being used actively, but plenty of space remains to add more FAQs or product documents.

⚡ **Quick Recap:**

* **Chat Counts** = How many conversations started.
* **Messages** = Total exchanges during those chats.
* **Storage Characters** = Size of your training data.

Monitoring these together gives you a **complete picture** of chatbot usage and when to scale up.
