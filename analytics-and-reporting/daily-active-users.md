# Daily Active Users

The **Daily Active Users (DAU)** metric shows how many unique visitors interact with your chatbot on a daily basis. This is one of the most important indicators of engagement, helping you understand both traffic patterns and bot adoption.

***

#### What DAU Tracks

* **Unique Users per Day** → Each visitor is counted once per day, even if they chat multiple times.
* **Engagement Frequency** → Helps you see how often your audience is using the bot.
* **Growth Over Time** → Compare usage trends (daily, weekly, monthly) to measure adoption.

***

#### Why DAU Matters

* **Customer Engagement**: A rising DAU means your chatbot is attracting more attention and being used regularly.
* **Performance Benchmark**: By tracking DAU alongside conversations and messages, you can see whether users return daily or just once.
* **Plan Scaling**: If DAU is steadily growing, you may need to upgrade your plan to handle higher message volumes.

#### How to Use DAU Insights

1. **Spot Trends**: Monitor daily spikes to identify marketing campaigns, product launches, or events driving more traffic.
2. **Optimize Timing**: If most users are active at certain hours, adjust your bot’s greeting message or promotions to align with peak times.
3. **Measure Stickiness**: Compare DAU to Monthly Active Users (MAU) to understand how often visitors return. A high DAU/MAU ratio indicates strong user engagement.

#### Example

* On Monday, **50 unique users** interacted with your bot.
* On Tuesday, DAU dropped to **20 users**, but message count stayed high.
* Insight: Fewer people used the bot, but those who did had longer, more detailed conversations.

***

⚡ **Tip:** Combine DAU with **Chat Counts** and **Messages** to get a full picture:

* **High DAU + Low Messages** → People open the bot but don’t engage deeply (fix greeting/fallback).
* **Low DAU + High Messages** → Fewer users, but highly engaged (expand training content).
