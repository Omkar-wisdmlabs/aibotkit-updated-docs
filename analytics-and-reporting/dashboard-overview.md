# Dashboard Overview

AI Bot Kit includes a built-in **Analytics Dashboard** that helps you track how your chatbot is performing in real time. This section gives you an overview of conversations, messages, and usage trends so you can continuously improve your bot.

***

#### Key Metrics

On the dashboard, you’ll find the following top-level metrics:

* **Total Chatbots** → How many chatbots you’ve created in your account.
* **Total Conversations** → The total number of unique conversations your bots have handled.
* **Total Messages** → The number of messages exchanged across all conversations.
* **Storage Characters** → How much of your allocated character storage is being used.

These numbers update dynamically as your visitors interact with your chatbot.

***

#### Daily Activity Overview

The **Daily Activity graph** provides a timeline view of conversations and messages.

* The **green line** represents conversations (number of sessions started).
* The **purple line** represents messages (total exchanges inside those sessions).
* You can adjust the time window (7 days, 30 days, etc.) to monitor short-term or long-term activity.

This helps you understand peak usage times, busiest days, and how engagement changes over time.

#### Why Analytics Matter

* **Optimize Training** → See what questions your bot struggles with and improve its knowledge base.
* **Measure Growth** → Track how many people are engaging with your bot daily.
* **Plan Upgrades** → Monitor if you’re hitting message or storage limits and decide when to upgrade plans.
* **Customer Insights** → Understand what your users are asking most, and tailor your site or services to match demand.

⚡ **Tip:** Check your analytics weekly to spot trends early. For example, if you see spikes in certain questions, you can add targeted answers or documents to your training for better results.
