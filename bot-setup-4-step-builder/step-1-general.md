# Step 1: General

The **General** tab is where you set the basic details and personality of your chatbot.

* **Bot Name**: Enter a name that your visitors will see. This helps make your chatbot feel personal and recognizable.
* **Bot Instructions**: Write a short introduction or guidance message to set the right expectations. For example:\
  &#xNAN;_“I’m here to help answer your product questions and guide you through the site.”_
* **Activate Chatbot**: Toggle this switch when you are ready to make your bot live on your site.
* **Bot Tone**: Choose how your bot should sound:
  * **Professional** → Formal and business-like responses
  * **Friendly** → Warm, approachable, and conversational
  * **Casual** → Relaxed, informal, and engaging

This step sets the **personality** and **voice** of your chatbot, making it feel natural to your audience.
