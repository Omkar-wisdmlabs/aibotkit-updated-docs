# Step 3: Interface

The **Interface** tab controls how your chatbot communicates with visitors.

* **Initial Greeting Message**: This is the first message shown when someone opens the chatbot. Example:\
  &#xNAN;_“Hello! 👋 How can I help you today?”_
* **Fallback Message**: This appears when the chatbot doesn’t understand a question. Example:\
  &#xNAN;_“I don’t have an answer for that yet. Can you rephrase your question?”_

These settings ensure your bot always responds — even if it doesn’t know the exact answer — and keeps the conversation flowing.
