# Step 4: Styles

The **Styles** tab is where you design the look and feel of your chatbot widget.

* **Theme Selection**: Choose from multiple chat window layouts.
* **Bot Avatar**: Select or upload a custom image/icon to represent your bot.
* **Widget Icon**: Choose the button design that triggers the chatbot.
* **Primary Color**: Adjust colors to match your brand (with gradient option).
* **Font & Size**: Customize text style for consistency with your website.
* **Position on Screen**: Place the chatbot in the **bottom-left** or **bottom-right** corner.

This step ensures your chatbot visually blends with your website design and brand identity.
