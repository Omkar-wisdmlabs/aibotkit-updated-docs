# Start from Website Analysis

The first step in creating your chatbot is to analyze your website.

1. Go to [AI Bot Kit](https://aibotkit.io/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and click **Get Started**.
2. Enter your website URL into the analyzer box.
3. AI Bot Kit will automatically scan your site, pulling in:
   * Your **brand colors**
   * **Layout and style preferences**
   * Core content to understand context

This analysis helps your chatbot look and feel like a natural part of your site from the very beginning.
