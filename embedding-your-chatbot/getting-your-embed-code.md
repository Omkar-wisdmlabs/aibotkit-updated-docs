# Getting Your Embed Code

Once your chatbot is set up, the final step is to make it visible on your website. AI Bot Kit provides a simple code snippet that you can copy and paste directly into your site.

***

#### Getting Your Embed Code

1. After saving your chatbot, go to the **Preview & Launch** screen.
2. Under **Embed on your website**, you’ll see a code snippet like this:

```html
<div id="ai-bot-kit-chatbot" data-chatbot-id="XXXXXXXX"></div>
<script src="https://app.aibotkit.io/embed.js" async defer></script>
```

3. Click **Copy Code** to copy the snippet.
4. Paste this code into the `<head>` or `<body>` section of your website’s HTML.
   * For site-wide installation, place it in the global **header/footer** section.
   * For a single page, paste it into that page’s custom HTML block.

💡 **Tip:** If your site uses a website builder (like Squarespace, Wix, or Shopify), add the embed code using the “Embed” or “Custom Code” block.
