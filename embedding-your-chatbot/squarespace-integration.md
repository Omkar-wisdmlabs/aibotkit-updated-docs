# Squarespace Integration

AI Bot Kit can be added to your Squarespace site in just a few steps. Since Squarespace is a visual builder, you donâ€™t need to edit raw code files â€” you simply use the built-in **Embed Block**.

#### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Log into Squarespace** and open your site dashboard.
2. Navigate to the page where you want your chatbot to appear.
3. Click **Edit** to enable page editing mode.
4. Hover where you want the chatbot and click **+ Add Block**.
5. From the list of options, choose **Embed**.
6. In the Embed Block, switch to **Code Snippet** view.
7. Paste the AI Bot Kit **embed code** you copied from your dashboard:

```html
<div id="ai-bot-kit-chatbot" data-chatbot-id="XXXXXXXX"></div>
<script src="https://app.aibotkit.io/embed.js" async defer></script>
```

8. Click **Apply** and preview the page to make sure the bot loads correctly.
9. Finally, hit **Save** in Squarespace.

Your chatbot is now live and ready to engage visitors on your Squarespace site.

#### Pro Tips

* If you want the chatbot to appear across your **entire site** (not just one page), go to **Settings â†’ Advanced â†’ Code Injection â†’ Footer** and paste the code there.
* Always preview before publishing, to ensure it doesnâ€™t overlap with other widgets or content.
