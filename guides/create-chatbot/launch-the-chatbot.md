**Option 1: Embedded Chat Interface**

```
[ai_botkit_chat id="your-bot-id"]
```

This shortcode embeds a chat interface directly within your page content.

**Option 2: Floating Widget**

```
[ai_botkit_widget id="your-bot-id"]
```

This shortcode adds a floating chat bubble widget that appears in the corner of your site.

Simply copy either shortcode and paste it into any WordPress page or post where you want the chatbot to appear. The plugin provides a convenient copy-to-clipboard button for each option.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Important Setup Requirements

**Before Your Chatbot Will Work:**

1. **Activate Your Chatbot**:
