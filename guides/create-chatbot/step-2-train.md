### <mark style="color:blue;">Step 2: Training Your Bot</mark> üìö

_Teaching your chatbot what it needs to know_

#### **Why This Step Matters:**

Without training, your chatbot can only give generic answers. With proper training, it becomes an expert on YOUR specific business, products, and services.

#### **Three Training Methods:**

**üìù Method 1: Import from WordPress**

**Best for:** Using content already on your website

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Select Content Types**
   * Check boxes for content types you want (Posts, Pages, Products, etc.)
   * Use "Select All" for everything or pick specific types
2. **Preview Content**
   * Click "Preview Content" to see what will be imported
   * Review the list of posts/pages
   * Check boxes next to content you want to include
3. **Import Selected**
   * Click "Import Content"
   * Watch as content is processed (usually takes 1-2 minutes)

**üí° Smart Selection Tips:**

* **Include:** About pages, service descriptions, FAQ content, product information
* **Skip:** Contact forms, outdated posts, draft content
* **Start small:** Pick 5-10 high-quality pieces initially



**üìö Method 2: Select from Knowledge Base**

**Best for:** Using documents you've already uploaded

**How to Use:**

1. Search through your existing knowledge base
2. Check boxes next to relevant documents
3. Selected items automatically train your bot



**üìÑ Method 3: Upload New Content**
