_Customizing how your bot communicates_

#### **What You'll Set Up:**

**üëã Initial Greeting Message**

* **Purpose:** First thing visitors see when they open the chat
* **Default:** "Hi there! How can I help you today?"
*   **Customization Tips:**

    * Make it specific to your business: "Welcome to \[Company]! How can I assist you today?"
    * Include what you can help with: "Hi! I can help you with orders, product info, and support questions."
    * Keep it friendly and inviting



**Examples by Business Type:**

* **E-commerce:** "Welcome to our store! I can help you find products, check orders, or answer questions about shipping."
* **Service Business:** "Hello! I'm here to help you learn about our services and get your questions answered."
* **Support:** "Hi there! I can help troubleshoot issues, explain features, or connect you with the right team."



**ü§î Fallback Message**

* **Purpose:** Shown when the bot can't answer a question
* **Default:** "I don't have an answer for that. Can you rephrase your question?"
*   **Better Examples:**

    * "I don't have information about that yet. You can try rephrasing your question or contact our team at \[email]."
    * "That's outside my knowledge area. Let me connect you with someone who can help: \[contact info]."
    * "I'm still learning about that topic! You can reach our support team at \[contact] for more help."
