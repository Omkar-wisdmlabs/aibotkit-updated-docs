# Where to Find Your Usage

AI Bot Kit makes it easy to track your plan usage directly inside the dashboard. This ensures you always know how many messages, chatbots, and storage characters you’ve used, and when you may need to upgrade.

#### Current Plan Overview

At the top of the **Plans & Billing** page, you’ll see your **Current Plan** box. This shows:

* **Plan Type** → Free, Basic, Essential, or Business
* **Messages Left** → e.g., “50/50” means you’ve used all 50 free messages for the month
* **Start Date** → When your plan began
* **Renewal Date** → When your plan resets (monthly or yearly depending on billing cycle)

This acts as your **real-time usage tracker** so you don’t have to guess.

#### When to Upgrade

You’ll know it’s time to upgrade when:

* You see a **warning message** about reaching your monthly message limit.
* Your **storage usage** gets close to the maximum.
* You want to create more chatbots than your plan allows.

⚡ **Tip:** Upgrading mid-cycle is seamless — your usage carries over instantly without downtime.
