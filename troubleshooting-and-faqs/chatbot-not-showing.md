# Chatbot Not Showing

If you’ve embedded your AI Bot Kit code but your chatbot is not appearing, don’t worry. This is a common issue and usually easy to fix.

***

#### 1. Check if You Saved Your Bot

* After setup, make sure you clicked **Save Chatbot** in the dashboard.
* Unsaved bots won’t generate a valid embed code.

***

#### 2. Verify Embed Code Placement

* Copy the embed code from **Preview & Launch**.
* Ensure it’s pasted in the correct location:
  * **Site-wide** → Place in your site’s **footer or header** (via code injection).
  * **Single page** → Paste into a **Custom HTML** or **Embed block**.
* Double-check that no part of the code is missing.

***

#### 3. Clear Browser Cache

* Sometimes browsers load an older cached version of your site.
* Clear your cache or open the site in **Incognito Mode** to test.

***

#### 4. Conflicts with Other Scripts

* If you already have multiple widgets or tracking codes (like chat tools, pop-ups, analytics), they may conflict.
* Try placing AI Bot Kit’s code **at the very bottom** of your footer (before `</body>`).

***

#### 5. Plan Limit Reached

* On the Free Plan, your bot stops working after **50 monthly messages**.
* Go to **Plans & Billing → Current Plan** to see if you’ve hit your usage limit.
* If yes, upgrade to a higher plan to reactivate your chatbot.

***

#### 6. Browser or Ad Blockers

* Some ad blockers or privacy extensions can hide third-party scripts.
* Test on another browser or disable extensions temporarily.

***

#### 7. Still Not Working?

If none of the above resolves it:

* Re-copy a fresh **embed code** from your dashboard.
* Remove the old code → paste the new one → save and publish.

If it still doesn’t appear, contact support via the **Help Center** inside your dashboard.
