# Re-training Your Bot

AI Bot Kit allows you to update and re-train your chatbot anytime. This is useful if you’ve made changes to your website, added new FAQs, or uploaded updated documents.

***

#### When Should You Retrain?

* You’ve updated your website content and want the chatbot to reflect the changes.
* New products, services, or policies were added.
* Visitors keep asking questions your bot can’t answer.
* Old or irrelevant documents need to be replaced.

4. **Add or Update Knowledge**
   * **Upload Documents** → Add new PDFs, Word files, or other docs.
   * **Add URLs** → Insert new website links you want the bot to learn from.
   * **Add Text** → Paste FAQs or guidelines directly into the editor.
5. **Remove Old Data (Optional)**

#### Best Practices for Re-training

* Keep your knowledge base **clean and organized**.
* Use short, clear documents rather than overloading one huge file.
* Retrain regularly (e.g., monthly) to keep responses fresh and accurate.
* Test the bot after retraining to confirm it answers correctly.

#### Example

* Before: Bot didn’t know about your new refund policy.
* Action: You uploaded the updated **Refunds & Returns PDF**.
* After: The bot can now instantly answer refund-related questions.

⚡ **Tip:** Re-training is unlimited — you can add or update knowledge sources anytime as your business grows.
