If you don't want the chatbot to responsd to any certain set of words, you can add them in banned words list. If the user types in that words, chatbot won't simply respond & give fallback message :&#x20;

"This message contains banned content"

Similarly if there is any IP address you want to ban from using your chatbot you can add the IP address in the security tab.
